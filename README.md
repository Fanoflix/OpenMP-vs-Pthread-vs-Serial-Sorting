# OpenMP-vs-Pthread-vs-Serial-Sorting

This project compares different types of parallel programming techniques (pthread , openmp) and serial programming to determine which of these method is most efficient. Three different types of sorting algorithms will be tested/checked with each of these techniques to give detailed analysis and determine the most consistent and efficient programming method.
